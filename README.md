It is designed as a static portfolio project exploring guest behavior, booking trends, and cancellation patterns using data from 2016 to 2018. The dashboard consists of four dedicated pages â€” Bookings, Revenue, Guests, and Cancellations â€” each focused on a specific area of hotel operations. The repository contains a few basic SQL scripts where I practiced preparing the dataset for analysis. These scripts focus on simple tasks like cleaning missing values, adjusting column names or data types, and creating new columns from existing ones. It's not complex SQL or view-building â€” just straightforward data preparation steps to make the table ready for use in Power BI.

ðŸ“Š Report Structure:

  -The report was intentionally built as a fully static layout â€” cross-filtering between visuals is disabled to maintain a clean and consistent design.
  
  -Users can filter the report using a bookmarks panel
  
  -Each report page is focused on a specific analysis area: Bookings, Revenue, Guests, and Cancellations.
